# Hale-Capital
Building a trade bot through the Alpaca API. Want it to be abstract enough to implement
various strategies relatively easily. Will begin by implementing traditional strategies,
and as this process matures, would like to begin implementing reinforcement learning
models in lieu of strategies.

A back-end *may* need to be stood up at some point in the future. Will need to evaluate
what Alpaca stores versus what we need.

The bot will be deployed to GCP Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
